OUTSIDER SAYS:

This is a mod of the sentient robot known as Ultron. It has the artificial intelligence and excellent powers & abilities to destroy any enemy, and be an ideal ally for the Alliance. Though Ultron is sometimes called a "he" or "him," I call Ultron an "it." But nevermind that.

One unit of the mutant hunting Sentinels now acts as a stand-alone mod. It has some of Ultron's powers, but also some of its' own, so it plays different. Check it.
