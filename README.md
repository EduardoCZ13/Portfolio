This is a repository of the projects I've worked on before. 

-For the Xiphophorus project, the main file is the Proyecto-Xiphophorus.html file. It is in spanish. 
-The Web projects are in process, the Roll20 sheet is based on the app.roll20.net/ architecture, which is currently being translated to HTML. 
-The DotA2 mod is not currently active in the game because of recent patches. This is the workshop page: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1985193214 The following link is a proof of how the mod worked when it was active. Planning on making it work again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEcUPZsVOlY&ab_channel=Baumi
